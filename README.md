# RAG Football Chatbot

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot designed specifically for football enthusiasts. This intelligent assistant combines the power of OpenAI GPT models with custom data retrieval to provide accurate, dynamic, and contextually relevant answers about football matches, players, stats, and more.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This chatbot leverages LangChain for managing conversational AI workflows and retrieval from a scalable Astra DB database. It features a sleek, responsive React frontend built with Next.js and animated using Framer Motion for smooth user experience. Puppeteer is optionally used for scraping live football data to keep the knowledge base up-to-date.

### Why RAG?

Traditional chatbots rely solely on generative models that can hallucinate or provide outdated info. RAG combines generative AI with document retrieval, grounding responses on real data ‚Äî ensuring accuracy and trustworthiness in football-related queries.
